Data Warehouse Schema Design Overview

In this lab, I designed a data warehouse schema using Lucidchart to map relationships based on business requirements. The project focused on real-world scenarios like automobile sales, emphasizing the distinction between fact and dimension tables to create an optimized and flexible data structure.

Purpose

The goal was to design a schema that supports analytical queries and reporting, with clear differentiation between measurable metrics (fact tables) and descriptive attributes (dimension tables), aligned with business needs.

Key Components

Fact Table: Centralized metrics such as sales revenue and quantities sold.
Dimension Tables: Attributes like Customer, Location, Time, Make, Model, and Price to contextualize analysis.

Highlights

Developed a schema for automobile sales with a new Brand Dimension to enhance granularity.
Wrote an SQL script to define and test the schema, reinforcing practical SQL skills.
Explored creative extensions, such as a Super Bowl Championship schema, to apply concepts innovatively.

Significance
Improved Decision-Making: Supports analytics and trend-based insights.
Scalability: Designed for future data growth and evolving business needs.
Real-World Relevance: Practical application to scenarios like car sales.

This lab reinforced the importance of aligning technical solutions with business goals, blending creativity with structured problem-solving.
