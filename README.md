I enjoyed this lab a lot. Several ideas came to mind when looking at examples to help understand how this can be mapped out. 

The fact table is anything that can be measured. The dimension tables are like attributes that describes what you're trying to measures. 

The first picture is the data warehouse. I added the dimension of brand. With the way I think, I would want to be as detailed as possible but not over complicate it. I'm thinking it depends on the business needs at the time and the customer they're working with. 

The last two are automobile sales I came up with along with the sql script.
